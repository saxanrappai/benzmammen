A simple man who passionately loves God and wants to pursue His will.<br/>
Earlier I was in the business having a Bar Hotel and a Lodge in the heart of Mavelikara Town ( named- Embassy) also I was into the film industry as well.<br/>

When I had been totally submerged in the world of deplorable sins.<br/>
Miraculously JESUS CHRIST saved me from all of my sins and recognized me has His child .<br/>
Now this old Bar Hotel and this premises converted into JESUS LIVES CHURCH .<br/>
Hundreds of souls regularly gather to Worship GOD in every Sunday.<br/>
