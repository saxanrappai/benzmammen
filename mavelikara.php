<p><strong>
	The Cultural Capital of Central Travancore</strong><br/><br/>
	Mavelikkara, (Malayalam: മാവേലിക്കര) is a taluk and municipality in the Alappuzha district of the Indian state of Kerala. It is located in the southern part of the district on the banks of the Achankovil, and is one of the oldest municipalities of the state[citation needed]. <br/>It also has a very strong historical and cultural background; <br/><br/>It was also a major place of trade and commerce in ancient Kerala and the erstwhile capital of the rulers of Onattukara.<br/> As a result of the close association with the Travancore Royal Family, Mavelikara gained modern facilities well ahead of other places in the state. <br/>This includes a fullfledged transport station and its development into a municipality. Even before India attained independence, Mavelikara had to its credit a super express transport service to Trivandrum.

The Mother Teresa Trophy Boat Race is held during Onam along the stretch of the River Achankovil.<br/>
